## Description

RoboAmigos is a user-friendly application that fetches and displays a list of robot "friends". The main focus of the project is to demonstrate the capability of React, asynchronous data fetching, state management, and user-driven interactions such as searching and filtering.

## Features

- **Dynamic Search**: Instantly filter out robots based on user input.
- **Responsive Design**: The design is clean, simple, and adapts well to both desktop and mobile views.
- **Scrollable List**: Regardless of the number of robot friends fetched, the app remains clutter-free thanks to a scrollable container.
- **API Integration**: Fetches robot data in real-time from `jsonplaceholder.typicode.com`.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **CSS**: For styling components to enhance the visual appeal.
- **jsonplaceholder**: A fake online REST API used for testing and prototyping.
